Great! Shifting to **historical data** makes things a bit easier because you're not dealing with the complexities of real-time data streaming and API rate limits. Instead, you'll be fetching past stock and option data, which can be processed and analyzed offline or on-demand.

Here's a suggested folder structure for your project, considering your objectives and the different components involved (option pricing, country/stock selection, data fetching, AI summarization, etc.).

### **Folder Breakdown & Files Description**

---

#### **1. `app.py` (Main Streamlit App)**
This is where the user interacts with the tool. The app includes:
- Sidebar for **country selection** and **stock options**.
- Interactive components for viewing **historical data** (e.g., option chains).
- Various **visualizations** for option pricing, Greeks, P/L, etc.
- A section where users can execute trades and get **summarized insights** via Llama.

---

#### **2. `requirements.txt`**
List of Python dependencies needed to run the project.

Example:
```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
plotly
yfinance
scipy
openai
matplotlib
seaborn
```

---

#### **3. `data/`**
This folder stores all data-related components, both raw and processed.

- **`raw_data/`**: Store raw historical data files here (e.g., stock prices, options chains). These can be CSVs, JSON files, or any other format.
- **`processed_data/`**: Cleaned and processed data (e.g., ready-to-use option chains, adjusted stock prices, or computed Greeks). This makes it easier to work with when building visualizations or AI summaries.
- **`stock_data/`**: Subfolder for each country's market. For example:
  - `US/` for U.S. stocks,
  - `DE/` for Germany,
  - `IN/` for India, etc.
  
You can organize data here by country and stock ticker to simplify fetching and organizing data for different markets.

---

#### **4. `models/`**
This folder contains core model implementations and utility functions.

- **`black_scholes.py`**: Contains the implementation of the **Black-Scholes option pricing model**. Also include any other option pricing models you might use.
- **`llama_integration.py`**: Contains the code that communicates with the **Llama (or GPT)** API. This will handle summarizing the trade execution, risk assessment, and other AI-driven outputs.
- **`utils.py`**: Helper functions used across different scripts, such as computing **Greeks** (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) or calculating adjusted strike prices.

---

#### **5. `visualizations/`**
This folder contains scripts for generating various plots related to option analysis.

- **`option_greeks.py`**: Visualizations for displaying the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) on a graph.
- **`option_pl.py`**: Visualizations for **Profit/Loss** of options relative to the stock price.
- **`volatility_impact.py`**: Visualizations showing how option price changes with volatility.
- **`time_vs_price.py`**: Option pricing against **time to maturity**.
- **`heatmap.py`**: Sensitivity heatmaps for option prices relative to volatility and strike prices.
- **`common.py`**: Shared functions used across visualizations (e.g., axis formatting, layout settings).

---

#### **6. `data_fetching/`**
This folder is responsible for fetching and processing historical data.

- **`yahoo_finance.py`**: A script to fetch historical stock and options data from **Yahoo Finance** (e.g., using `yfinance`).
- **`alpha_vantage.py`**: (Optional) Script to integrate with **Alpha Vantage** API to fetch market data if required.
- **`data_utils.py`**: Helper functions for cleaning and formatting the raw data fetched from APIs, like handling missing data, converting timestamps, etc.

---

#### **7. `assets/`**
Any static files required for the frontend of the app (e.g., images, logos, or any other files that are not directly part of the Python code but needed for display).

---

#### **8. `tests/`**
Testing is essential to make sure each component works as expected.

- **`test_black_scholes.py`**: Unit tests for the Black-Scholes model.
- **`test_visualizations.py`**: Unit tests for visualizations (check if graphs are being generated correctly).
- **`test_data_fetching.py`**: Unit tests to ensure correct data is fetched and processed.
- **`test_llama_integration.py`**: Unit tests for the integration with Llama (to make sure AI summaries are being generated as expected).

---

#### **9. `README.md`**
- Brief documentation of your project.
- Instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- Information about the APIs being used (like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).

---

### **Implementation Steps (High-Level)**

1. **Start with Data Fetching**:
   - Implement the logic to pull historical stock data (you can begin by using Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`).
   - Ensure you can get the stock data and related option chains for different markets (countries).

2. **Option Pricing Models**:
   - Implement the Black-Scholes model and ensure it works with historical data.
   - Add Greeks calculations, and integrate them with your visualizations.

3. **Build the User Interface**:
   - Use **Streamlit** for the interface where users can select countries, view available stock options, and interact with visualizations.
   - Integrate **Plotly** for interactive graphs and charts.

4. **AI Integration**:
   - Implement Llama (or GPT) integration for trade execution summaries and risk analysis.
   - Allow users to input their trade selections and get a summary from the AI.

5. **Testing**:
   - Start writing unit tests for each major component: Black-Scholes, data fetching, Llama integration, and visualizations.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Data Fetching**: Implement the logic to get stock and options data for the first country (e.g., US).
2. **Black-Scholes Model**: Ensure your Black-Scholes model works with the data.
3. **Visualizations**: Work on creating the interactive plots to visualize Greeks, P/L, and other data points.
4. **AI Integration**: Build out the Llama-based summary.
