 Detailed Explanation of the Folder Structure:
data/:

raw/: Contains the raw data files, typically .csv files downloaded from sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.
processed/: Contains cleaned and formatted data files, which have been prepared for use in Backtrader. This might involve converting the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame or Backtrader-compatible format (e.g., PandasData).
strategies/:

Contains Python scripts, each defining a different strategy (e.g., moving average crossover, MACD, Bollinger Bands, RSI). Each strategy is encapsulated within a class that inherits from bt.Strategy, which allows you to backtest multiple strategies easily.
You can add as many strategies as you like here, and keep them separate to ensure modularity.
backtest/:

backtest_runner.py: The main script for running the backtest. It will import different strategies from the strategies/ folder, load data, and execute the backtest.
performance_metrics.py: Contains functions to calculate performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized returns.
plot_results.py: Contains code for visualizing the performance of each strategy, including equity curves, trade highlights, etc.
config/:

settings.py: Stores configuration options, such as the initial capital, commission rates, slippage, and the stock tickers for testing. This makes it easy to change configurations without touching the strategy code.
logs/:

backtest_log.txt: Log file for storing detailed information about the backtest process, such as strategy results, errors, or warnings.
requirements.txt:

A file listing all the Python packages required for the project (e.g., backtrader, pandas, matplotlib, yfinance). This allows for easy environment setup via pip install -r requirements.txt.
main.py:

The entry point for running your backtests. This script will import everything, load the data, select the strategy, and invoke the backtesting process.
README.md:

A markdown file containing project information, instructions for running the code, and how to add new strategies or configure the system.
